        <p>I am Aks, designer and founder of “Aks Mathur”, based in Seattle. ‘Aks Mathur’ brand has emerged from the desire to express ideas through useful designs. I choose to punch and paint on pieces of leather to communicate my thoughts rather than oh-so-common words. The result is a collection of premium designer hand crafted leather goods that exude brilliant uniqueness. Each product is a fruit of intense thought process followed by laborious hours spent in workshop with an intention of   expressing my love for art through useful creations. The promise that I make is that every product is an art-piece that has been carefully handcrafted right through cutting, stitching and painting. The intricate details in each product will remind you of my focus on usability and powerful designs of my passion for beauty to deliver exclusive high quality leather products. I started my journey in 2013 by creating ‘The Naked Alien’ - a Luxury Leather accessories brand. This was a start for my passion to use leather as a canvas to express myself. In 2017, “The Naked Alien” evolved into “Aks Mathur” with the same intention of creating art pieces where each design is handcrafted to include intricate details that embody beauty and usability.
